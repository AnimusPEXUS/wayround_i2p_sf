sourceforge.net does not provide rsync or ftp access for downloads,
enforcing use of it's http/html site.

while heanet and mirrorservice.org provides some rsync access, none of
them are synchronizend with sf.net 

(this is confirmed with this page:
http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Mirrors/ .

""" 
Please keep in mind that not all mirrors will be enabled at once
(mirrors sometimes are pulled from rotation), and not all mirrors have
all files; some of the mirrors listed here may not be shown when you
try to download a file.
"""
)

so. this project is aimed to help access files on sf.net
programmaticly.
